To run AMARE, open the terminal of your running system. Navigate through your
directory path to the folder where AMARE and input files are placed. Notice that all
input les have to be located in the AMARE including folder. To execute AMARE, a
Perl interpreter must be installed on the current system. Linux and Mac OS systems do
not need a subsequent installation because the Perl interpreter is usually included as a
standard tool. Unfortunately, Windows users have to install a Perl interpreter ex post.
AMARE has to be started directly via command line. Therefore, commands and chosen
options have to be typed in one row in the terminal. Starting AMARE via command
line simplies the implementation of AMARE into complex process pipelines. Navigate
through your directory path to the folder where AMARE and your files are located and
type the name of the AMARE version, followed by a blank and the demanded setup
options with a minus (-) sign in front of each. Then press enter.
